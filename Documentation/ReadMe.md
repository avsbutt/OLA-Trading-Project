Online Account Application (OLA) Overview
The Online Account Application (OLA) system allows users to create and manage various types of trading accounts, including Personal, Entity, and Retirement accounts. Each account type has specific requirements, and applicants are asked to provide details such as Social Security Number, name, address, phone number, bank details, and other necessary information. Brokerage firms can also customize their landing pages via white labeling.

Roles and Responsibilities
Client:

Users can sign up, create, or continue applications.
Access to a dashboard that displays all associated applications and their statuses.
Create a new application if no "Not Completed" application exists.
Representative, Operator, and Supervisor:

Created by a Broker Supervisor who assigns the appropriate roles and permissions for managing and verifying applications.
Representatives verify the application data and documents, while Operators assist with processing, and Supervisors manage application statuses and oversee the process.
Broker:

Brokers are created by an Admin or System Administrator, who has elevated permissions to oversee the application process, manage representatives, and ensure regulatory compliance.
Application Process
Sign Up/Login:

Clients create an account or log in to manage applications.
Application Types:

Personal Accounts: For individual users requiring personal information.
Entity Accounts: For businesses or organizations, requiring entity-specific data.
Retirement Accounts: Specifically for retirement plans like IRAs.
Verification and Review:

Applicants complete the necessary forms and submit them for review.
FIS verifies the information before the account is approved.
Dashboard and Application Management:

Clients can track the status of their applications (e.g., "Not Completed," "Under Review," "Approved").
Applications can be created or resumed if no "Not Completed" application exists.
This structured approach ensures that applications are managed efficiently, roles are clearly defined, and all information is verified for regulatory compliance.




Moreover, Testomat.io Reporting is integrated into the testing framework to generate detailed test reports. These reports provide insights into the testing process and results, helping developers and QA teams identify and address any issues promptly. The application follows the Page Object Model (POM) structure to organize test code efficiently, promoting reusability and maintainability. Overall, the OLA trading application aims to offer a secure, user-friendly, and efficient platform for trading, supported by a rigorous and well-structured automation testing framework.
